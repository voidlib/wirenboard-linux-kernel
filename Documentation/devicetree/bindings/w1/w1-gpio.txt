w1-gpio devicetree bindings

Required properties:

 - compatible: "w1-gpio"
 - gpios: one or two GPIO specs:
		- the first one is used as data I/O pin
		- the second one is optional. If specified, it is used as
		  enable pin for an external pin pullup.

Optional properties:

 - linux,open-drain: if specified, the data pin is considered in
		     open-drain mode.

Also refer to the generic w1.txt document.

 - pu-gpios: optional GPIO to control external "strong pull-up" FET.
			 if not specified, data I/O pin will be used in output mode to
			 emulate strong pull-up.
Examples:

	onewire {
		compatible = "w1-gpio";
		gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		pu-gpios = <&gpio 123 0>;

		battery {
			// ...
		};
	};
